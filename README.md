### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Why I develop this [GRBL1.1](https://github.com/gnea/grbl) extension for [Scratch3.0](https://scratch.mit.edu/). One day my son and I were playing with scratch3.0, my son asked me wheather he could play my [GRBL1.1 5 axis](https://github.com/perivar/grbl-Mega-5X) mahine with scratch3.0? I thougth it must be ok and tried a lot to search web. But I didn't find any available solution right now. Then I decide to write my own one. I'm not experienced programmer and it is a little difficult to figure out all code without example. The scratch hardware extension like Wedo are all connected with bluetooth. For my GRBL are connected by an USB cable and communicate with my computer with com port. After searching I found a Scratch3.0 based software called KittenBlock have some examples illustrating how to use USB com port to control hardware. So I decide to write my grbl extension for Scratch3.0 with [KittenBlock](https://www.kittenbot.cc/pages/software) first and try adopt to Scratch3.0 later on. Now I have created an extension for KittenBlock that can control my GRBL well. I hope you can like it.
